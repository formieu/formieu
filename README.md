# Hi there 👋

- I'm currently working on something cool! 👍

## Server's
- **Darkway RP (2022)**  
  A successful WL-off roleplay server owned by a friend. I contributed as a LUA developer.  

- **ECLIPSE (2024)**  
  A successful WL-off roleplay server that I owned. I handled 100% of the server's development in collaboration with Focaan, covering both LUA scripting and UI design.
